MITx_6.00.2x - Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science
https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computational-thinking-and-data-4

I completed this online course with MIT university during Nov-Dec 2020, and created these mindmaps as a study aid for myself. Hopefully others doing the course will find it useful too.
In general, mindmaps helps us to organise and link topics to help our brains assimilate and remember the information. It's also a quick way to search for topics during the exams.

I believe I have captured most of the important facts from the lectures, but please let me know in the discussion section if you find any mistakes or omissions. I didn't have time to read all the recommended chapters from the text book.

I've provided 3 different formats: pdf, HTML and the original SimpleMind format. 
You only need to download one of them.

If you want to be able to edit and add your own notes, you should use the SimpleMind format. You can download the free version of the SimpleMind software from here: https://simplemind.eu/
Feel free to upload your improvements as a branch.

There are several links to other sources embedded inside the mindmaps. These links will work from any of the 3 formats.
Also note, there is a link from the main mindmap (MITx 6 00 2x - MindMap - v2) to the other one (Probabilities Mindmap - v1). If you download the Website (HTML) format you only need the main one because it already includes the Probabilities one.

Please let me know in the Discussion if this is useful. It took quite a bit of time to put it together, so it will motivate me to do this with my next MIT course as well.
